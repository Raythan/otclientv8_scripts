[Cenário sala de estar falando diretamente com a câmera]
[PROMPT TÉCNICO]: "Cinematic 8K hyper-realistic vertical video (9:16). A professional woman in her late 30s, acting as a psychologist/coach, sits in a modern, cozy office. Visual details: High-fidelity skin textures, visible pores, subtle micro-expressions on the forehead and corners of the eyes. She has a warm, empathetic gaze, maintaining direct eye contact with the lens. Lighting: Soft Golden Hour natural light streaming from a large side window, creating a gentle rim light on her hair and a soft glow on her skin; volumetric dust particles dancing in the light beams. Environment: Background is a sophisticated library with wooden shelves and lush green Monstera plants, rendered with a creamy f/1.8 bokeh blur. Movement: Natural 'active listening' body language; she tilts her head slightly, her chest rises and falls with deep, calm breaths. Her hands move gracefully in mid-air to emphasize points, showing soft finger articulation. Sync: The lip-sync is perfectly articulated and synchronized with the provided audio script, showing realistic tongue and teeth movement. The facial muscles react to the emotional weight of the words."

[PROMPT TÉCNICO - DESCRIÇÃO VISUAL HIPER-REALISTA] "Cinematic 8K hyper-realistic vertical video (aspect ratio 9:16). A female psychologist/professional coach, aged late 30s, sits in a cozy, modern consulting room. She looks directly into the camera lens with a warm, empathetic, and trustworthy expression. Lighting & Atmosphere: Intense Golden Hour natural light streams from a large window on the left side of the frame, casting warm, soft, golden light across her face and hair, creating a gentle rim light. Volumetric dust particles are visible dancing in the sunbeams. The air feels calm and warm. Subject Details: High-fidelity facial textures; visible pores, natural fine lines around the eyes when smiling gently, and subtle micro-expressions of compassion and active listening (slight head tilt, slow blinking). Her breathing is deep and calm, visible in the gentle rise and fall of her chest. Action & Movement: She uses soft, fluid hand gestures to emphasize points—not rigid, but organic movements of fingers and palms. Natural, perfectly synchronized lip-syncing to the provided audio script, showing realistic tongue, teeth, and jaw movements corresponding to the words. Background: A beautifully blurred (creamy bokeh, shallow depth of field, f/1.4 lens style) background featuring wooden bookshelves filled with books and lush green plants (like a Monstera deliciosa). The focus is razor-sharp on her eyes.


[MASTER PROMPT: CENA NOTURNA (ESTILO LO-FI / INTIMISTA)]
[PROMPT TÉCNICO - DESCRIÇÃO VISUAL LO-FI REALISTA] "Cinematic 8K hyper-realistic vertical video (9:16). A female psychologist/coach in her late 30s, in a cozy dim-lit office at night. Lighting & Atmosphere: Lo-Fi aesthetic. The primary light is a warm, soft glow from a vintage desk lamp (amber tone) on one side of her face. The other side is bathed in a faint, cool blue/purple ambient light reflecting from the window. Background: Through the window, a city skyline at night is visible with a heavy bokeh effect (soft circles of neon lights). Subtle reflections of the room are visible on the window glass. Subject Details: Ultra-high-fidelity textures. Skin looks natural under artificial light; slight glint in the eyes reflecting the desk lamp. She has a peaceful, deeply reflective expression. Her movements are even slower and more deliberate than in daylight, conveying a sense of 'late-night heart-to-heart' conversation. Action & Movement: She leans slightly forward, as if sharing a secret or a deep truth. Gentle, rhythmic breathing. Her hands move in small, comforting gestures near her chin or chest. Perfect lip-sync to the Portuguese audio script, with realistic micro-movements of the mouth and jaw in low-light conditions. Environment: Intimate and quiet. A steaming cup of tea might be partially visible on the desk. The focus is sharp on her face, with a very shallow depth of field (f/1.2 style)."

[DIÁLOGO_SCRIPT]:
- Você já sentiu que, por mais que durma, o cansaço parece que não sai de dentro de você? Como se a sua bateria estivesse viciada?
- Primeiro, observe se você está vivendo no 'automático'. Aquele estado onde você faz tudo o que precisa, mas não sente prazer em nada do que conclui. É a desconexão emocional.
- Depois, note a sua paciência. Pequenos imprevistos estão gerando reações desproporcionais? Quando o corpo chega no limite, a irritabilidade vira o nosso único mecanismo de defesa.
- E, por fim, a dificuldade de dizer 'não'. Muitas vezes, o seu esgotamento vem do espaço que você deu para o mundo e tirou de si mesma. A falta de limites é o que mais drena nossa energia.
- Se você se identificou com um desses pontos, saiba que não precisa carregar tudo isso sozinha. O primeiro passo é o acolhimento, não a culpa. Qual desses três pontos mais ressoou aí hoje? Vamos conversar nos comentários.
